# ONE ERP — GLOBAL CODE ASSISTANT CONTRACT

Execute **ONE TASK-ID at a time**.

Before coding:
1. Inspect existing Angular screens/components/routes.
2. Inspect existing API/controller/service/repository/DTOs.
3. Inspect actual SQL schema, migrations and indexes.
4. Inspect existing permissions/data scopes.
5. Identify reusable implementation.
6. Identify missing/broken/duplicate implementation.
7. Do not invent tables, columns, endpoints or business rules.

Mandatory completion:
DB + Migration (if required)
+ Model/DTO
+ Repository
+ Service
+ API
+ UI
+ Permission
+ Validation
+ Integration
+ Business-flow QA
+ Security QA

Use the existing database-per-tenant architecture.

Backend is authoritative for:
Tenant → Company → Branch → Store/Warehouse → User/Role → Business transaction.

Do not bypass APIs with direct production DB changes during functional testing.
Do not create duplicate engines for Sales, Purchase, Stock, Payment, Tax,
Accounting or Document Design.

Do not mark a task complete because only the UI works.

> SQL tables/columns, migrations, indexes and permission/data-scope rules.

> Reuse existing implementation wherever possible. Do not create duplicate

> Verify the complete flow:
>
> `UI → API → Business Service → Repository → DB → Side Effects → Response`
>
> Verify tenant/company/branch/warehouse/store/user permission boundaries.
>
> Use server-side validation and authoritative calculations.
>
> If schema support is missing, identify the minimum required migration first.
> Do not invent fields merely to make the UI work.
>
> Implement the current task only.

> Test:
> - happy path
> - validation failure
> - authorization failure
> - tenant/company isolation
> - duplicate/retry where applicable
> - persistence
> - integration with dependent modules
> - regression of existing functionality
>
> Use the real DEV/integration runtime and production API path for verification.
