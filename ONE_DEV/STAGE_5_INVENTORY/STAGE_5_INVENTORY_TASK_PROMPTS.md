# ONE ERP — GLOBAL CODE ASSISTANT CONTRACT

Execute **ONE TASK-ID at a time**.

Before coding:
1. Inspect existing Angular screens/components/routes.
2. Inspect existing API/controller/service/repository/DTOs.
3. Inspect actual SQL schema, migrations and indexes.
4. Inspect existing permissions/data scopes.
5. Identify reusable implementation.
6. Identify missing/broken/duplicate implementation.
7. Do not invent tables, columns, endpoints or business rules.

Mandatory completion:
DB + Migration (if required)
+ Model/DTO
+ Repository
+ Service
+ API
+ UI
+ Permission
+ Validation
+ Integration
+ Business-flow QA
+ Security QA

Use the existing database-per-tenant architecture.

Backend is authoritative for:
Tenant → Company → Branch → Store/Warehouse → User/Role → Business transaction.

Do not bypass APIs with direct production DB changes during functional testing.
Do not create duplicate engines for Sales, Purchase, Stock, Payment, Tax,
Accounting or Document Design.

Do not mark a task complete because only the UI works.
